# Managing Inventory

Keep your inventory accurate and up-to-date with DMS Business Care's warehouse management tools.

## Viewing Stock Levels

Navigate to **Warehouse > Inventory** to see real-time stock levels across all your locations. Use filters to search by product, category, or warehouse.

## Updating Stock

Stock levels update automatically when orders are processed and deliveries are confirmed. You can also make manual adjustments under **Warehouse > Adjustments**.

## Stock Alerts

Set up low-stock alerts under **Settings > Notifications** to get notified when products fall below your specified threshold.

## Inventory Reports

Generate detailed inventory reports under **Reports > Inventory**. Export to CSV or PDF for sharing with your team.
